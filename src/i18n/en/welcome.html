  <p>Here are what some players are saying about RPG MO:</p>

  <div class="content">
    <blockquote style="color: rgb(71, 255, 193);" class="message_box col">
      “I enjoy the open world aspect, the fact that I can go anywhere and do anything I want really
      appeals to me in a
      mmorpg game like this. There are tons of items and features that can be explored and will keep me interested for
      many
      weeks to come. Best of all, this game is free. I don’t have to pay in order to match other players.”

      “I enjoy the laid back, old school feel of the game with an awesome community!”
      <br><span>– Roase</span>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="color: rgb(255, 223, 176);" class="message_box col">
      “Simple, yet highly addictive. Has many features of some similar big-budget games, but with a
      much better community of
      players, mods and developers. Similarities could be cast with some other AAA+ MMO's out there, but the only
      advantage
      they actually have is the graphics. Gameplay, depth and community I would all choose RPG MO over the competing
      MMOs.”

      RPG MO is an online multiplayer role-playing game that gives players the opportunity to explore many paths.
      Players
      can build up combat and magic skills and acquire spells, weapons and armor to become formidable fighters, and they
      also may build up crafting skills and create items for themselves or for sale to others.
      <br><br>The game is an open-world sandbox experience where players may choose their own road, and a key component
      of
      gameplay is a vibrant player market where any object may be sold to other players. It is a true free-to-play game;
      even the most desirable items can be acquired from other players with in-game currency that is built up through
      gameplay.
      <br><br>RPG MO is created with adult gamers in mind, and progress into higher levels will not come quickly.
      Younger
      players also may enjoy gameplay, particularly if they are willing to be patient and develop skills. It is free to
      play
      and no downloads are required. It even works in your smartphone and tablet.
